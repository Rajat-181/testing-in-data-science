# Testing in Data Science

This repo includes materials for a presentation and optional hands-on-tutorial for introducing testing for data science in Python using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries.

The `intro-to-testing-presentation.ipynb` notebook is intended to be rendered as slides (see the \*.html or \*.pdf version), and the `step-by-step-demo-walkthrough.ipynb` is the instructor's guide to leading the attendees through several steps of test driven development from the template file `demo_tdd_intro.py` to the completed version `complete-demo_tdd_intro.py`.

### Versions

Several different versions of this presentation have been given to different audiences, so if you are looking for specific versions of the talk, checkout the various branches on this repository.

- [`pycon-version`](https://github.com/jesford/testing-in-data-science/tree/pycon-version) is the most recent version of this talk given at PyCon 2019 in Cleveland; essentially a shortened version of the `pydata-version` talk.
- [`pydata-version`](https://github.com/jesford/testing-in-data-science/tree/pydata-version) is the full version of the talk presented at PyData SLC, and replaces the hands-on demo with a demo-like slide segment that includes screenshots of the steps in the tutorial.
- [`pyladies-version`](https://github.com/jesford/testing-in-data-science/tree/pyladies-version) was an early iteration of these materials delivered to the Salt Lake PyLadies, included a longer hands on demo, and did not delve into hypothesis.
